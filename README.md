# **Deep Learning Lab Practicals**

This repository contains lab practicals from the **Deep Learning** course at [Your Institution Name]. The projects cover key topics in deep learning, including logistic regression, cost and loss functions, development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and more.

## **Folder Structure**

All datasets are stored in a single folder for simplicity and easy access:

- **Datasets Folder**:  
  Contains all the datasets required for the practicals, including datasets for Logistic Regression, Cost & Loss Functions, Gradient Descent & Regularization, and Potato Disease Prediction.

- **HR Folder**:  
  Implements **Logistic Regression** to classify human resources data. It covers the basics of logistic regression and its applications in binary classification.

- **Insurance Folder**:  
  Focuses on **Cost & Loss Functions**, **Gradient Descent**, and **Regularization**. It demonstrates how to optimize a machine learning model using these techniques to improve accuracy and avoid overfitting.

- **Potato Disease Folder**:  
  Implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to predict potato disease from images. This project explores image classification with deep learning techniques and demonstrates how CNNs can be used for real-world applications like agriculture.

## **Datasets**

All required datasets can be found in the `Datasets` folder. You will find datasets related to the following:

- HR dataset for Logistic Regression
- Insurance dataset for Cost & Loss Functions and Gradient Descent
- Potato Disease dataset for CNN-based prediction

Ensure you load the appropriate dataset in the respective notebook to run the practicals.

## **Installation**

To run the lab practicals, ensure you have the required dependencies. You can install them using the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
